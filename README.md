# Analysis of Various Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms for Intrusion Detection, Springer LNNS 28 Aug 22
• Aimed to use supervised machine learning techniques in python to train the system, classify the normal and anomalous as
well as identify unknown attacks on IoT devices.
• Coordinated research to detect network attacks based on parameters in UNSW-NB15 Dataset and created 9 new
parameters.
• Applied XGBoost and Random Forest-based feature selection to achieve test accuracy of 88.7% and the FAR of 0.014.
