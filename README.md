-Aimed to use supervised machine learning techniques in python to train the system, classify the normal and anomalous as well as identify unknown attacks on IoT devices using the famous UNSW-NB15 Dataset.
-Created 9 new parameters and implemented Random Forest-based feature selection to finally narrow down to 21 features.
-Applied 17 Algorithms that helped successfully achieve test accuracy of 88.7% and a FAR of 0.014 through the XGBoost Classifier.
